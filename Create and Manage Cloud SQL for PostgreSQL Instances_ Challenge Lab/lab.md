- **install the pglogical database extension and jquery**
```
sudo apt install postgresql-14-pglogical
```

- **Download and apply some additions to the PostgreSQL configuration files (to enable pglogical extension)**
```
sudo su - postgres -c "gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gsp918/pg_hba_append.conf ."
sudo su - postgres -c "gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gsp918/postgresql_append.conf ."
sudo su - postgres -c "cat pg_hba_append.conf >> /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf"
sudo su - postgres -c "cat postgresql_append.conf >> /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf"
sudo systemctl restart postgresql@14-main
```

- **Apply required privileges to postgres and orders databases**
